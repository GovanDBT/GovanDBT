# Thembi Govan Dibotelo
Hi! Iâ€™m Thembi Govan Dibotelo, a Full-Stack Developer from Botswana with a strong focus on JavaScript-based technologies. I specialize in building dynamic, user-focused web applications using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Next.js, and Node.js, but Iâ€™m also proficient in backend languages and frameworks like Java (Spring Boot), PHP (Laravel), and Python (Django).

My experience extends to working with relational and non-relational databases, including MySQL, MongoDB, Oracle, and PostgreSQL, and I enjoy solving problems with clean, scalable code.

I'm particularly passionate about JavaScript because of its versatility across the stack and how quickly ideas can be brought to life with its frameworks and libraries. I also have a strong eye for design and regularly use Figma for creating UI/UX mockups and prototypes.

In addition to development, Iâ€™ve worked on freelance projects using CMS platforms like Webflow and Odoo, building custom SaaS and eCommerce solutions.
