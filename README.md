Hi there, my name is Thembi Govan Dibotelo from Botswana. I do graphics and content designs and developement for websites and Mobile Apps. I enjoy learning new languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, PHP and coming up with beautiful and innovative ideas and mockup for websites and apps using Abobe XD, Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. I study Computer Science at the University Of Botswana and mostly surrounded my work and study around Web App Development, Software Engineering, Data Science and Networking.

## Recent Project
![Current Project](https://github.com/GovanDBT/GovanDBT/blob/main/Screenshot%20(39).png)
 This is a website where students in Botswana can have access to school resources online, its something that is not new but we are hoping it can bring about a change to how students are taught in Botswana. Students from Primary all the way to senior school can have unlimited access to school material like books, test papers, notes and more all in one place.
